## 1. What is in `paper/` right now

### Tables (`paper/tables/`)

| Table file | Experiment | In paper text? |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| length_gen_cumsum.tex | Length gen (cumsum) | ✓ §Length generalization |
| length_gen_parity.tex | Length gen (parity) | ✓ §Length generalization |
| length_gen_dyck2.tex | Length gen (Dyck-2) | ✓ §Length generalization |
| length_gen_dyck1.tex | Length gen (Dyck-1) | Optional; not \input in main text |
| length_gen_last_token.tex | Last-token (failure case) | ✓ §When ION does not help |
| depth.tex | Depth stability (MNIST) | ✓ §Depth stability |
| mnist.tex | MNIST classification | ✓ §MNIST |
| ablation_lambda_cumsum.tex | λ on cumsum | ✓ §Ablations |
| ablation_lambda_mnist.tex | λ on MNIST | ✓ §Ablations |
| ablation_p_dim_cumsum.tex | p_dim on cumsum | ✓ §Ablations |
| ablation_p_dim_mnist.tex | p_dim on MNIST | ✓ §Ablations |
| mechanistic_ablations.tex | P-only, F-only, etc. | ✓ §Ablations |

**Total:** 12 table files. All are for experiments that the paper describes.

### Figures (`paper/figures/`)

- Only `create_placeholders.py` and `README.md` are present.
- No PDF/PNG figure files. Figures are produced by `python -m src.run_figures_tables` from `results/` and would be written here when that script runs.

## 2. CIFAR-10 and LRA

### CIFAR-10

- **In the paper:** **No.** The paper uses only **MNIST** for depth and image experiments. There is no mention of CIFAR-10 in `paper/`.
- **In the code:** **Yes.** `run_depth.py` supports `--dataset cifar`; depth-on-CIFAR runs write to `results/depth/cifar/`.
- **Results on disk:** **Yes.** e.g. `results/depth/cifar/accuracy_vs_depth.csv`, `summary.json`, and per-depth runs exist.
- **In the paper directory:** **No.** The figure/table pipeline only uses `results/depth/` (MNIST depth). It does not read `results/depth/cifar/` or produce any `paper/tables/` or `paper/figures/` for CIFAR-10. So **CIFAR-10 results are not present in the paper directory.**

### LRA (Long Range Arena, ListOps)

- **In the paper:** **No.** The paper does not mention LRA or ListOps.
- **In the code:** **Yes.** `run_lra.py` runs LRA ListOps (Transformer vs ION-Transformer); results go to `results/lra/listops/`.
- **Results on disk:** **Yes.** e.g. `results/lra/listops/ion/summary.json`, `results/lra/listops/transformer/summary.json`, and run files exist.
- **In the paper directory:** **No.** There is no analysis code that turns `results/lra/` into LaTeX tables or PDF figures, and no CIFAR/LRA references in the paper. So **LRA results are not present in the paper directory.**

## 3. Summary

| Experiment | Results in `results/` | Table/figure in `paper/` | Mentioned in paper text |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Length gen (cumsum, parity, Dyck-1/2, last_token) | ✓ | ✓ (tables); figures generated by script | ✓ |
| Depth (MNIST) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Depth (CIFAR-10) | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| MNIST classification | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ablations (λ, p_dim) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mechanistic ablations | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Invariant drift | ✓ | Figure generated by script | ✓ |
| **LRA (ListOps)** | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

**Conclusion:** All experiments that the paper actually describes have corresponding results and (after running `run_figures_tables`) table/figure outputs that live in or are written into `paper/`. **CIFAR-10 and LRA are implemented and have results under `results/`, but they are not referenced in the paper and their results are not included in the paper directory** (no CIFAR/LRA-specific tables or figures are generated for the paper).

To include CIFAR-10 or LRA in the paper you would need to:
1. Add narrative and table/figure references in the paper (e.g. in `experiments.tex`).
2. Extend the analysis pipeline to produce LaTeX tables and (optionally) figures from `results/depth/cifar/` and `results/lra/listops/`.
3. Optionally add `run_depth --dataset cifar` and `run_lra` to `scripts/run_all_experiments.sh` so the full suite produces those results.
