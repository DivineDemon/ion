# Paper figures

All paper figures live in this directory only. They are generated by the analysis scripts (e.g. `python -m src.run_figures_tables` or `src/analysis/plots.py`), which write here by default.

- **Rebuild figures:** from repo root run `python -m src.run_figures_tables` (reads from `results/`, writes figures here).
- **Placeholders:** if figures are missing (e.g. before running experiments), run `python paper/figures/create_placeholders.py` from the repo root to create minimal PDFs so the paper compiles.
- **Build:** Compile `main.tex` on Overleaf (or any LaTeX editor); `main.tex` uses `\graphicspath{{figures/}}`.
